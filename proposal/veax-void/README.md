Readme for PIGS or Pixelwise Image Graph Segmentation project developmet.

## Basic information
[Official PIGS repo](https://github.com/veax-void/nsdhw_21sp/tree/veax-void-proposal)

Fast package for image segmentatioin using graphs, like your dad use to make! 

## Problem to solve

Image processing, especially segmentation tasks are really heavy on computations, but also provide a lot of value. 
Graph partitioning provides a powerful approach to image segmentation.  
I propose to use fast cpp code for make computation of relations in the graph more efficient.  

**TODO**: add math and algorithm

## Perspective users
All people who use image data representations mostly. But this package for programmers who want to integrate fast graph segmentation in to their projects.

## System architecture

**TODO**: Make a system dataflow, add charts!

## API
**TODO**: Add API

## Infrastructure
**TODO**: TESTS, DOCS, version control, CI/CD
